# Rules of Jester
Adds Rules of Nature from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance as the jester song. 
**CAUTION: the sound it makes when popping out has been edited to be the song, making it seamless**

Just change `JackInTheBoxTheme`, `Pop1` and `Scream1` with the files you prefer.
At the time of this update, CustomSounds may not yet support ogg and mp3, use wav if you wanna make sure it works.

## Manual Installation
1. Install BepInEx
2. Install LCSoundTool
3. Install CustomSounds
4. Create a `CustomSounds` folder and add a `JesterSound` folder to it, then add `JackInTheBoxTheme`, `Pop1` and `Scream1`
